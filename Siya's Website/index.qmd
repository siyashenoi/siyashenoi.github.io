# *Welcome to my website!*

My name is Siya, and I'm thrilled to have you here. I'm currently a second-year student pursuing a bachelor's degree in statistics with a minor in computer science at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo.

Throughout my academic journey, I have developed a deep liking for the world of data. Statistics has provided me with a strong foundation in analytical thinking, allowing me to extract meaningful insights from complex datasets, using skills such as probability theory and regression analysis.

On this website, I invite you to join me on my journey through the world of statistics, computer science, and data visualization. I'll be sharing my projects, insights, and work and college experiences.

Outside of statistics, you can usually find me at the gym, baking cakes, or spending time with my pet dog and lizards :-)
