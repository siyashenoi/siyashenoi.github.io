# Overall, I would say making the website was pretty confusing. The documentation for the quarto website options was not easy to follow and I had to use a lot of trial and error to get my desired result, as well as using some html-style code which was sort of new to me. I also had a lot of issues getting the code to commit into the repository. 

# Although, I do think the template of the website is stunning and I'm really happy that I was able to make this.
